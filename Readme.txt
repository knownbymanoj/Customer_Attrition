Problem statement:

Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs

Scenario:

Looking at statistics from the European Business Review, it is astounding to see that telecommunications companies lose about $65 million a month due to client attrition. Isn't it much too expensive?

The power of data & statistics may be used to analyze the factors that impact customer attrition, identify customers who are most likely to churn, and offer them some discounts.
